			DW Size 70968 bytes

	Need to get around your directories fast and simply.  Force yourself
to read fully this doc file and I think you will find this program of great
use.  What makes DirWork better than the rest ?

	VERY Configurable.  Buttons/Button-keys/Options/Screen Mode/
	Screen Colors/Window Size/Window Position/PopKeys/Tools etc can be
	modified and the DW executable modified to have these values.
	External configuration editor program to make changes easier.

	Detaches.  So when you type DW from Shell/CLI you can still use your
	Shell/CLI as if nothing happened.  No need to Run!  Paths are kept!

	Sleep. Can be put to sleep so it disappears completely until you
	select it from the workbench tools menu (kick2.0-) or press left
	Ctrl-Shift-Alt-D or whatever keys you configured it to.
	Also can be started in sleep mode so "DW -s" in your
	startup-sequence will have it there for when you want it later.
	You can also place DW in your WBStartUp drawer and add the ToolTypes
	SLEEP & DONOTWAIT.

	Intelligent.  Double click the left mouse button on the filename of
	a IFF picture and it will be automatically displayed.  Double click
	a text file to display it, press the right mouse button to edit it!
	Double Click a .lzh file and you see the contents, right mouse
	button on one extracts the contents to the destination dir and then
	reads in the new entries.  If you have a middle button then pressing
	it on the .lzh will extract the files in the background so you can
	continue doing other things.
	As well as many other instant actions on different types of files
	and the instant types are configurable.

	The inbuilt text viewer, picture viewer and disk functions
	run as separate processes on separate screen so you can double
	click a text file and then continue working with DW then swap
	the screen and the text viewer is still there.  Your diskcopy
	can be going on one screen while you a copying files with DW as
	normal.

	A show built in that loads in the next picture while your looking
	at the last.  Does icons, SHAM and some DHIRES pictures.  You can
	of course set up a button to use your own show utility.

	Buffered directories.  Press the right mouse button over the dir
	text gadget and you get a menu of previous directories which you
	can instantly go to.  Parent buttons that will use the buffered
	dir when appropriate to save you heaps of dir loading time.

	A completely mouse controlled type/hxtype which will automatically
	decrunch powerpacker crunched text files.

	Both memory and BootBlock virus checking.

	Inbuilt Diskcopy/Format/Install with multiple destinations etc.

	PopKeys.  Define keys to start up programs. eg make Amiga-P start
	your paint program.  Amiga-Escape start a NewShell etc etc etc
	Also adds these programs to DW's menu and your workbench Tools menu
	if using Kick2.0-.

	ScreenBlanker so that the phosphors on your monitor get a rest.
	AutoPoint option so that the window the mouse is over is selected.
	MouseAccelerator with selectable threshold.

	Copy & move cloning so that the date/protection/filenote is same.

	Fast and Smooth Floppy Dirs!  Getting a directory off a floppy
	is up to 2 times faster.  And your drive doesn't grind back and
	forward anywhere near as much as normal.

	Size.  At less than 70K uncompressed it makes mince meat of most
	of those huge memory hungry utilities.

Actual directory text (Left Directory or Right Directory)

	Pressing the Right mouse button when over the text showing the path
	of the dir brings up a menu of previous directories as well as a list
	of volumes.  If you just let go over the text gadget it will read
	that directory into the file list.
	eg If DF0: was in the Left Directory text gadget you could insert
	   a new disk into the internal disk drive DF0: and then press the
	   right mouse button over the DF0: in the Left directory text to
	   read in the new directory.
	If you move down onto one of the previous directory names and let go
	it will be fetched from memory (it won't read the disk to get it)
	since it is buffered from when you recently read that directory.  If
	you let go on of the volumes (these are a list as if you pressed the
	volumes button and are indented one to the right) it will be read in
	from disk.

	Pressing the left mouse button over the far left/right of the text
	gadget(see the "/" in window representation above) gets the parent.
	Parent makes DF0:t/r become DF0:t
	Right button gets the root. Root makes DF0:t/r become DF0:
	If the Parent buf option is on (is by default) and the last directory
	you read is the same as the new one the buffered copy of the dir is
	used. ie if you get the dir "DF0:" then "DF0:??" then press parent
	or root buttons "DF0:" will not be re-read from disk, the buffered
	copy will be used instead.

	You can press the left mouse button over the left or right directory
	text gadget then edit the directory to the one you want to work with
	and then if you press return the directory will be read in.
	These gadgets can be activated by the keys Del & Help for left &
	right respectively (see DWEdit if you want to change these keys)
	Remember in most string gadgets right Amiga X clears the text in
	the gadget, and you can use shift -> or <- to go to end or start
	of the text.


FileList(s)

	Press the left mouse button to select/deselect a file or directory
	name.

	Right mouse button or double click left button on a directory reads
	in that directory.

	Left mouse button to the far left or right of a file/dir will
	bring up a requester with information about the file/dir
	the Filename, FileNote and Protection bits which you can edit.  As
	well as the size and date(only if using kickstart 2.0- or you have
	the arp.library).  If you select a file the title bar of this
	information window will tell you what instant type DW would have
	used if you had double clicked this file.  If this instant type is
	ILBM (a IFF picture file) it will also tell you the
	Width*Height*Depth.

	Use the slide gadget to see files that are not displayed.  You can
	also put the mouse pointer over the file list and press the key of
	the first letter of the filename you are interested in and the file
	list will move to the files/dirs starting with that letter.

	Double Click of left Button on a file will try to recognize the file
	and automatically do something with the file(eg With default settings
	the quickly double clicking the left button on a text file will type
	it & and double clicking on a IFF picture(such as a picture from a
	paint program) file will show it with the internal show).

	Right Mouse Button on a file will try to recognize the file and
	automatically do something with the file.
	eg With default settings the Right mouse button on a text file will
	   edit it (If you have configured your instant edit to your editor
	   or it already is) or pressing the right mouse button on a picture
	   file will show it with Mostra(© Sebastino Vigna) if you have that
	   program.

	Middle Mouse button will also do another selectable action if you
	have one on your mouse and have Kickstart 2.0-.

Buttons
	The main idea is to press the left mouse button if you are referring
	to the source as the file list below the pointer.  So to copy from
	the left file list to the right list, click on the left copy
	button.  And to copy from the right file list to the left file list,
	click on the right copy button.

	You can also click on a button with the right mouse button to refer
	to the opposite file list but if this sounds confusing just ignore
	this paragraph.
	(eg Left button on left DF0: will get the directory from DF0:
	and put it in the left file list, but right button on left DF0: will
	get the directory DF0: and put it in the right file list)

	Below is a description of what the buttons will do when the default
	setup is used.  You can modify button functions to do something
	completely different if you want.

	DF0: DF1: RAM: SYS: etc
		Just press these to get the directory of this name in the
		file list below the pointer.

	Sleep	Puts the task to sleep until you press the four left keys
		Ctrl-Shift-Alt-D.  ie The window disappears as if you quit
		but the program is still there waiting until you press the
		keys.  So you don't have to load DirWork all the time.
		DirWork starts in Sleep mode if you type DW -s instead of
		the usual DW when you run it from Shell/CLI, or you add the
		SLEEP & DONOTWAIT tool types to the DW icon and start it
		from workbench.
		So you can have the command DW -s in your startup-sequence
		or DW in your WBStartup drawer then when you actually want
		DirWork later you just have to press the keys
		Ctrl-Shift-Alt-D or if running Kick2.0- just can select DW
		in the Tools menu of workbench.
		Do what you want then press the sleep button to make DirWork
		disappear again.  See PopKeys information for how to change
		the key combination that wakes DirWork up.

	Al	Select all files.  See DWEdit to make it select dirs as well.

	No	Unselect all files & dirs.  See DWEdit for other options.

	PatSe	Requests for a pattern to select matching file(s)/dirs(s).
		This button only works if you are running Kickstart 2.0-.
		You can toggle if you want Files, Dirs or both to be
		selected.  Matching is same as AmigaDOS 2.0:-

		?	Matches any character
		#	Matches the following expression 0 or more times
		(ab|cd)	Matches either item separated by the |.
		~	Nots the following expression.
		[abc]	Matches any of the characters in the brackets.
		[~ab]	Matches any of the characters not in the brackets.
		%	Matches 0 characters.

		Examples:-

		~(#?.info)  All files that don't end in .info.
		#?.dat      All files ending in .dat.



	<>	Swaps the left and right file list displays.

	>> & <<	Copies one file list to the other file list.

	Info	Updates the info(bytes Free and name). And displays how many
		dirs/files/bytes are selected.  Good to see if you are going
		to be able to fit all the file(s)/dir(s) you want to copy.

	Copy	Copies files/dirs from one dir to another.
		BytesFree for the source/destination is updated.
		See the DWEdit documentation if you want it to clone
		the original date/filenote/protection etc.

	CpyAs	Copies files/dirs from one dir to another.  Requests you
		for the destination name.
		BytesFree for the source/destination is updated.
		See the DWEdit documentation if you want it to clone
		the original date/filenote/protection etc.


	Move	Moves files/dirs from one dir to another.
		BytesFree for the source/destination is updated.
		See the DWEdit documentation if you want it to clone
		the original date/filenote/protection etc.
		Please note the DOS 1.2/1.3 bug where you lose directories
		if you move a directory to be a child of itself.  I
		intercept and stop some but not all.
		ie Move ONE ONE/ONE  !!!!IS NOT A GOOD IDEA!!!!

	Delet	Delete files/dirs.  You are prompted before non empty dirs
		are deleted for confirmation but see the DWEdit documentation
		section if you don't like this.
		BytesFree for the directory is updated.

	Print	Copies selected files text to the printer.
		See DWEdit for other options like Tabs to spaces.

	Renam	Rename files/dirs.  Edit names in the requester.
		Please note the DOS 1.2/1.3 bug where you lose directories
		if you move a directory to be a child of itself.  I
		intercept and stop some but not all.
		ie Rename ONE ONE/ONE  !!!!IS NOT A GOOD IDEA!!!!

	MakDi	Make a new directory. Enter name in requester.
		See the configuration section if you want it to also create
		a icon for the directory each time.

	Prote	Change delete protection of a file/dir.  Lets you toggle
		the delete protection of a file.  A file with delete
		protection on has a u next to the right of the filename.
		See DWEdit for heaps of different configs for this.

	CD	Makes the dir the current directory.

	Type	Displays a text file to a screen (overscan if kick2.0-).
		Use the slide gadget on right to quickly scan and use buttons
		down below to move through the file or toggle between a hex
		or ASCII display of the file.
		Or use keyboard:-
		  Return or CursDown or KeyPad2 or j = NextLine.
		  CursUp or Keypad8 or k = PrevLine.
		  Space or Shift/CursDown or KeyPad3 = NextPage.
		  BackSpace or Shift/CursUp or KeyPad9 = PrevPage.
		  Keypad7 or Ctrl/CursUp = Start of file
		  Keypad1 or Ctrl/CursDown = End of file
		  h to flip between Hex/ASCII.
		  s or LeftAmiga/s RightAmiga/s to search.
		  f or LeftAmiga/f RightAmiga/f to search.
		  Esc or q or Keypad5 = quit.

		It runs as a separate process so you can swap screens and
		use DW as normal until you don't what the text display any
		more.

		The screen height and mode can be set from DWEdit.

		The title bar shows the filename and will say
		"WAS POWERPACKED" if the file was crunched with powerpacker
		and has been decrunched.  It will say "PARTIAL LOAD" if you
		didn't have enough memory for the file so only some of
		it was loaded.
		By default a double click on a text file will call this
		routine.

	HxType	Displays a file in hexadecimal to a window.
		Use the slide gadget on right to quickly scan and use buttons
		down below to move through the file or toggle between a hex
		or ASCII display of the file.
		Or use keyboard:-
		  Return or CursDown or KeyPad2 or j = NextLine.
		  CursUp or Keypad8 or k = PrevLine.
		  Space or Shift/CursDown or KeyPad3 = NextPage.
		  BackSpace or Shift/CursUp or KeyPad9 = PrevPage.
		  Keypad7 or Ctrl/CursUp = Start of file
		  Keypad1 or Ctrl/CursDown = End of file
		  h to flip between Hex/ASCII.
		  s or LeftAmiga/s RightAmiga/s to search.
		  f or LeftAmiga/f RightAmiga/f to search.

		and has been decrunched.  It will say "PARTIAL LOAD" if you
		didn't have enough memory for the file so only some of
		it was loaded.
		By default Double click on a binary file will call this
		routine.

	Instant	This performs as if you double clicked the left mouse button
		on the selected files.  It will perform a relevant button
		on the file if it finds one otherwise it will assume the
		file is just binary and HxType it.  All these things can
		be changed, see DWEdit documentation.

	Show	Shows IFF files.  Loads in the next pic while the last
		is being displayed to save a lot of time.  Move mouse pointer
		to edge to scroll around a picture bigger than the screen.
		Use the left mouse button or press a key to go to next.
		If low on memory select one file at a time to display.
		By default a double click on a IFF picture file will call
		this routine.  Will handle SHAM as well as some DHIRES.
		Can display icons as well.  See DWEdit for more info on this.

		Keys:-
		
		Cursors - Move around a large bitmap at 16 pixels each press.
		Shift/Cursors - Move around at a page each press.
		Ctrl/Cursors - Move to extreme each press.

		Alt/Cursors - Move the view around a pixel at a time.

		l - Toggle INTERLACE.

		It runs as a separate process so you can swap screens and
		use DW as normal until you don't what the text display any
		more.

	PlaySS	Plays any file as a Sampled sound at 10000 samples/sec.
		Will use the correct rate if the file is a 8SVX.
		By default a double click on a 8SVX sound file will call
		this routine.

	Search	Search files for text that you are prompted for.
		The prompt has a UpperCase!=LowerCase option.
		It will tell you at want offsets in the file the text is
		found.

	AdIcn	Creates a project, tool, or drawer icon for any file(s)/
		dirs(s) specified this is good for when you have a program
		or a drawer(directory) that doesn't have icon.


	DskOp	Starts up the internal floppy copy/format/install program.
		During operations the track(0-159) and any ERROR number is
		shown you can stop any operation by pressing the close gadget
		of the window.  During any diskcopy "Non standard boot block"
		is shown under track if disk has a not normal bootblock.

		If you select the source as one of the destinations the
		complete disk will be put into ram and the WriteBuf button
		will be turned on.  You can the just keep selecting the
		WriteBuf button with any destination(s).

		It runs as a separate process so you can swap screens and
		use DW as normal until you don't what the text display any
		more.


	VMK	My MEMORY virus detector/killer.
		For a simple check to see that your memory is virus free.
		Does checks of many memory locations etc that are used
		by viruses.  If you get a alert use a good disk virus killer
		to clear up the problem.  See the separate program VMK v1.1
		for docs.


	The following buttons require you to have a external program and/or
	run in your c: or similar directory.

	Edit	Edit selected files. Requires a editor named E in a path

	Run	Run selected files.  You will be prompted for optional
		arguments. eg if you selected the file Diskcopy you
		might want to enter "DF0: to DF1:".
		If you have no files selected Run will be run so you will be
		requested for the program to run.
		By default pressing the right mouse button on a executable
		file will will call a similar routine.

	Commd	Enter commands in the Shell/CLI window then enter endcli to
		return to DW or if using Kick2.0- or later click the close
		gadget.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	2. Options in DirWork
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Menu Options

	Move the mouse pointer up to the left side of the title bar of the
	window and press the right mouse button.


	You can select if you want the last 8 directories read to be
	kept in memory so that they come up when you press the right mouse
	button over the path text gadget.
	This is defaulted to on.


	You can select whether you want Fast&SmoothFloppyDirs.
	Shouldn't be needed with Kick 2.0-.
	Note that the DirWork FSDirs does not make use of dos buffers that
	have been added using AddBuffers, but does very well with the two
	commercial diskbuffering programs.
	This is defaulted to off.


	You can select if you want the directory to be updated when you
	change the floppy disk in one of the drives. ie  If you have DF0:
	as either you source of destination path and insert a new disk the
	new directory will be automatically read in.
	This is defaulted to off.


	You can select if you want every inserted floppy disk's boot block
	checked to see if it is normal.  Note some bootblocks are not normal
	and are not viruses so when you insert a disk and get the requester
	saying this is not a normal bootblock only install if you know that
	the bootblock does not contain important information.  See the
	DWEdit documentation on how to allow XCopy boot blocks.
	This is defaulted to off.


	You can select if you want VMK(The virus detector) to be run every
	8 seconds.  You get a requester asking for options(see VMK docs).
	This is defaulted to off.


	You can select if you want the screen to blank after 8 minutes of
	no activity by the user.  A still image on a monitor is not good for
	it so this blanks the screen.  See the DWEdit documentation on
	how to set the amount of time the machine must be idle.
	This is defaulted to off.


	You can select if you want Directories displayed above files.
	This is defaulted to off.


	You can select if you want .info files to be displayed.
	This is defaulted to on.


	You can select if you want the close gadget box of the window
	to make dirwork sleep instead of quit.
	This is defaulted to off.


	You can select that DirWork is to have a screen of its own instead
	of using the workbench screen.
	This is defaulted to off.

Menu Functions

	The SAVE function will modify a DW executable to have the setup
	that you currently have.  You are prompted for the name of the DW
	which would most likely be C:DW.  If you have turned on the external
	config option (see DWEdit documentation) the function will first
	save "s:DW.config" before it prompts you to save it to the
	executable.
	BUTTONS/INSTANTACTIONS/MENUOPTIONS/WINDOWSIZE/WINDOWPOSITION/
	POPKEYS and heaps more are all saved with this command so set up
	DirWork how you like it then use this command.


	Use external configuration editor will execute the DWEdit program
	(you must have it in a valid path such as c:) and hence allow you
	to change the many configuration options that you can't from DW and
	change many the ones you can in a faster and easier way to
	understand.  Then when you quit DWEdit you can use the SAVE function
	to save all your changes to the DW executable.
	Here are some of the things that can be changed using DWEdit:-
		Screen Mode/Palette/Size
		Window/Size/Position/Colors
		AutoPointOption
		MouseAcceleration/Threshold
		Position Independent Button Selection Mode
		ButtonsBelowOption
		ScreenBlankTime
		Number of Bufferred Dirs
		Task Priority
		XCopyBootBlocks as "standard" option
		AutoActivate of Text Gadget Option
		Type startup ANSI option
		RMB activate option
		Parent buf option
		Left and right text gadget activate keys.
		No Duplicates of DW option
		VMK Time value
		External config file Option

	Changing a button:-
	You can change a button to make it do something slightly different
	to something totally different.  Just press on the button then go
	to the menu and select "Change last button pressed".   To change an
	instant action you just do the instant action then select "Change
	last button pressed".  You can also just do a binary edit of DirWork
	and change them that way.  But the most user friendly was is to use
	DWEdit via the "Use external configuration editor" menu item.
	Here is the technical format anyway:-
	"     ,       ,       "

	ChangePopKey allows you to change the keys that bring DirWork
	out of sleep and you can define many other keys to execute other
	programs. If you are running kick2.0- the programs are also added
	to the workbench tools menu.  They are always added to the DW
	tools menu.
	Use the DWEdit program for a more user friendly way of changing
	these entries.  By default there is a couple of entries including
	one to wake DW up (which must always be the first entry) and
	one to start a NewShell by pressing LeftAmiga-ESC.

	3. Hints/tips
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	If you are a registered user just describe what sort of button you
would like configured and I will give you the button configuration text for
it, if it is possible.

	To have the programs added to the tools menu under kick2.0-
workbench must be loaded.  So you might have to have DW -s after loadwb and
you might have to have a "wait 3" or similar command in between.

	If DW is launched from workbench it will have the paths that were
added before the loadwb command so put all your path additions before that
command in your startup-sequence.  If DW is started from a Shell/CLI it will
have all the paths that the Shell/CLI had at that point.

	For DW's text/hex viewer to decrunch powerpacked files you must have
the powerpacker.library in your libs: directory.

	Since Show, Type, & DiskOp run as separate processes you can quit
DW while they are still going.  But since they are executing from DW's
program memory DW will not really quit.  If there are "child" processes
still running DW goes into a delayed quit until the processes have been
exited from then it really quits.  But if you press the wake up keys or
similar or have no duplicates option set and start another DW while it is
in this delayed quit mode, it will start up and forget that you ever said
quit.  It forgives you for you mental lapse in actually wanting to quit DW !

	DW makes its screen public for kickstart 2.0- so you can open other
windows such as consoles on it.  The name of DW's screen is "DW Screen0"
where 0 increases as you run more DW's.

	You can stop a multiple file/dirs function (like copying more than
one file or deleting files and dirs) by pressing the left mouse button over
the error display area.  This is the area where the diskname and bytes free
is usually displayed.

	If you want to crunch DirWork use PowerPacker V3 or later as it
does the correct things, other crunchers may cause DW to crash when
launched from the Shell/CLI.  If you are using DW crunched you probably
will use the external config option (selectable with DWEdit).  To do this
go to DWEdit before you crunch DW and select the external config file
option then quit(using quit & Save button) DWEdit and SAVE config to
DirWork executable.  Then you can crunch DirWork and the config will always
be fetched/stored in "s:DW.config" file.
